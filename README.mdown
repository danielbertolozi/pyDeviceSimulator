# pyDeviceSimulator

Python script that simulates devices being detected by a sensor. Think about iBeacons passing by a Raspberry Pi.

Nothing very special, I'm just keeping this because I find myself using it often for testing.

# Usage

```
python3 DeviceSimulator.py [-h | --host] 'host' [-p | --port] 'port'
```

Where the arguments will be the destination the script will POST to.

The script depends on requests, so be sure to install it with:

```
pip3 install requests
```
